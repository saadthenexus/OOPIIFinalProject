## 📌 Project Overview

**"Savour the Flavours of Health"** is a console-based Java application developed to help users maintain a healthy lifestyle. It integrates nutrition tracking, personalized health metrics (BMI and BMR), meal and recipe planning, exercise logging, and a daily health journal into one seamless system.

The project demonstrates core object-oriented programming concepts such as encapsulation, abstraction, modularity, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## 🧠 Project Details

This system is designed with modularity and maintainability in mind. It includes the following key components:

- **User Profile** – Stores user’s age, height, weight, and gender.
- **BMI & BMR Calculator** – Calculates and provides insights based on user's body metrics.
- **Meal Planner** – Users can create meals using recipes and ingredients with nutritional data.
- **Recipe Manager** – Allows users to add, update, delete, and scale recipes.
- **Exercise Tracker** – Users can log exercise sessions with duration, intensity, and calories burned.
- **Daily Health Journal** – Aggregates meals, water intake, sleep hours, and exercises. Generates summaries and trends.
- **Data Persistence** – All data (User, Meal, Recipe, Logs) is stored using serialized `.dat` files under a dedicated `ClassInfo` directory.

The architecture strictly adheres to SOLID principles and avoids code smells like magic literals, large classes, and deep conditionals.
